<h3>Technical skills</h3>
Other than getting trained in all things diatom/bacteria/science (mostly during my stay at Ghent University, Belgium) I pursued training and education in data analysis and visualization. I started with learning the "R syntax and using R in statistical and graphic data analysis", "Basics of programming", "Programming in Python" at the [University Computing Center (SRCE)](https://www.srce.unizg.hr/en/node/281). 

Then I continued on more specialized workshops for data analysis pipelines and R aimed at biologists given by [Physalia](https://www.physalia-courses.org/) (mostly online during COVID pandemics):
- "Metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and multi'omics for microbial community studies"
- "Data analysis with the Tidyverse"
- "ISB virtual Microbiome Series"
- "Data visualization in R by ggplot2"
- "Unix and shell scripting for bioinformatics"

<h3>Personal development</h3>
To improve my interpersonal skills I often learn about how to "human" better in work settings. I was lucky to participate in workshops like "Training of trainers" that introduced me to the basics of business psychology and team management, while during "Leadership training" with [Penkala association](https://udruga-penkala.hr/) I got to learn more about effective leadership, a little bit of coaching, and communication.
