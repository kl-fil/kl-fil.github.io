Ever since I was a student I loved the idea of communicating complex ideas to general public, especially kids that are yet to decide if they want to continue their education in biology. Also, I hope sharing some of the experiences of being a PhD student in Croatia might help other potential/early PhDs with navigating their career choices.

<h3>Blogs</h3>
At the project pages I wrote [my first short blog post](https://www.turtlebiome.biol.pmf.hr/blog/) on "Microbial jungles" of sea turtles. For the [<b>International Day of Microorganisms</b>](https://www.internationalmicroorganismday.org) (marked on 17th of September) I wrote a [similar piece](https://www.internationalmicroorganismday.org/blog/what-can-we-learn-from-microbial-jungles-carried-by-sea-turtles) hoping to reach more microbial enthusiasts. 

For [<b>the microbiologist</b>](https://www.the-microbiologist.com/) I wrote a short piece on [<i>"Finding resilience"</i>](https://www.the-microbiologist.com/careers/finding-resilience-amidst-sea-turtle-associated-microbes/543.article) as a PhD student in Croatia during the COVID pandemic and after the Zagreb earthquakes of 2022.

<h3>Workshops</h3>
My department had a tradition of celebrating biology, which grew to celebration of all scientific fields during <b>"Day&Night"</b> at theFaculty of Science in Zagreb. [During those events](https://nocbiologije.biol.pmf.unizg.hr/fotografije/fotografije-2019/) in 2019 I co-organized workshops that aimed to educate schoolchildren on marine microbes. TurtleBIOME project also got young artists to paint turtle-inspired art in real time during the workshops.

During the [<b>European Researcher's Night</b>](https://www3.hrzz.hr/default.aspx?id=2614) in 2019 my supervisor Sunƒçica and I worked with 7th grade kids on discovering the microbes from plants in their schoolyard. The kids were divided in groups and worked on a plant of their choice. They got to present their results to the general public and enjoy becoming young scientists for a couple of days.

In 2020 it was more difficult to work with the general public so my colleagues and I worked on a [online workshop for the <b>Festival of Science</b>>](https://youtu.be/QkV0pQjtdXI).
