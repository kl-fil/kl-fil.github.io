During my PhD studies I had many opportunities to introduce turtle-associated microbes to diverse scientific minds. Here you can find the posters, slides and photos connected to some of the events.

<h3>18th International Symposium on Microbial Ecology (ISME18)</h3>
August 2022 - this symposium was held in Lausanne, Switzerland with more than 2000 attendees.
I presented a poster: Filek et al. "[More than just hitchhikers: a survey of bacterial communities associated with diatoms originating from loggerhead sea turtles](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362694499_More_than_just_hitchhikers_a_survey_of_bacterial_communities_associated_with_diatoms_originating_from_loggerhead_sea_turtles?_sg%5B0%5D=AwFdQ1hC0rxuS09xkK-UbO3cJ7vjXz1WsqqjsnQ_wTcASgnVS9J29PIWjr5crE1uuGqKzsf7D2AvfhgT5x3ar3w2aL6Z1fX3-Qtg1OWu.Skl1otHClFONGnHBtOv_MSUaBPQSGHJ0QaMbSpL7kmMZ_bPstn3t7_4L-6OGsV25zarkzy7o9VLEsNmO7L90RQ)".

<h3>FEMS Conference on Microbiology</h3>
June 2022 - FEMS Conference on Microbiology was held in Belgrade, Serbia and I gave a talk on my work performed during my stay at Ghent University (diatom-associated microbes and co-cultures).

<h3>7th Croatian Crongress of Microbiology</h3>
May 2022 - 7th Croatian Crongress of Microbiology was held in Sv. Martin na Muri, Croatia. I presented more about [bacterial communities associated with loggerheads](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360783159_Microbiota_of_marine_reptiles_it_is_about_more_than_just_the_gastrointestinal_tract).

<h3>9th Conference of Mikrobiokosmos</h3>
2021 December - 9th Conference of Mikrobiokosmos was held in Athens, Greece, I gave a [talk on endozoic bacterial communities in oral cavities and cloaca](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357179700_Loggerhead_sea_turtles_Caretta_caretta_and_their_microbes_characterizing_oral_and_cloacal_microbial_communities) of loggerhead sea turtles.

<h3>Online International Diatom Symposium</h3>
2021 August - International Diatom Symposium was supposed to be held in Yamagata, Japan but alas the pandemic has stricken. Here I presented a poster on [diatom co-cultivation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358277715_Loggerhead_sea_turtle-associated_epizoic_vs_non-epizoic_diatoms_isolation_identification_and_co-cultivation_experiments) (as at MLD6) but here I won a 1st prize for my work..

<h3>The Molecular Life of Diatoms 6 (MLD6)</h3>
2021 July - This meeting was held online due to pandemics and I presented first results on diatom co-cultivation experiments performed in Ghent, Belgium.

<h3>World Microbe Forum</h3>
2021 June - World Microbe Forum was one of the largest online meetings I attended. Here I presented a poster on [microbial communities of diatom cultures](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352933380_From_Sea_Turtle_Associated_Microbial_Biofilms_to_Diatom_Cultures_A_Bacterial_Perspective), the preliminary work done in Ghent, Belgium.

<h3>The Molecular Life of Diatoms 5</h3>
2019 July - This was my first congress/meeting (Norwich, UK) where I got to present some of the results in [epizoic diatom phylogeny](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352907159_A_polyphasic_approach_for_identification_of_epibiotic_diatoms_associated_with_loggerhead_sea_turtles_in_the_Adriatic_Sea). Here I was awarded a 2nd prize for my poster!
