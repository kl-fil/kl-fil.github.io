Ever since reading [Arthur C. Clarke's and Gentry Lee's <i>Rama series</i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendezvous_with_Rama#Books_in_the_series) (I have a soft spot for sci-fi, what can I say) I have been obsessed by the idea of <b>building a sustainable society</b> with tools given to us <b>by biology/biotech</b>. Microbes have always been big players on Earth and I believe we are in the Golder Era of harnessing their power and using it for good.

Driven by such ideas I applied to the first [EU TalentOn](https://talenton.eu/) in 2022 which <b>gethered young scientist</b> and provided a platform to network and produce ideas on how to <b>solve loal/global challenges</b> (as a part of EU Missions for 2030). There my team and I worked on a scalable biological filter that would harness the power of local biota to clean the seawater of local communities - and <b>we won the 2<sup>nd</sup> prize</b> in our Mission Arena which was very challenging as the competition was fierce. There I got to learn how startups work, which funding opportunities are available in Europe, and how big our ideas need to be to make the actual changes in the world that we need. 

In the future I plan to educate myself further in handling <big>big data</big> to succefully <b>employ microbes in solving local & global challenges</b> (biodiversity loss, ocean pollution, sustainable food production, health threats).
