I have taught laboratory exercises for **3 undergrad courses and 1 graduate course from 2019 to 2022 at the University of Zagreb**. For some of the courses I *designed my own laboratory exercises*, seminars and workshops that would *equip students with the skills needed to excel* in their academic endeavors and possibly, beyond academia.  In 2022 and 2023 I worked closely or **co-supervised master students** on their theses to help them learn how to ask questions, analyze and present data, and become *experts in their chosen projects*.

- **2021-2023** - *Mentoring master students* in data analysis and interpretation within TurtleBIOME project (one co-supervision)
- **2022** - *Pelagic Microbiology*; laboratory exercises for ERASMUS students (on-site)
- **2019-2022** - *Microbial Ecology*; laboratory exercises (on-site & remote)
- **2019** - *Histology and Histochemistry, Histology and embryology*; laboratory exercises (on-site)
 
Besides my official duties as university staff, I helped *Biology Students Association* members in forming research proposals, and reviewed sci-pop articles for their magazine *In Vivo*.

In the academic year 2022/2023 I was listed as **2nd best teaching assistant** (based on a student survey on 166 professors and teaching assistants across 85 courses). The ranking was based on a 1-5-point grading system and anonymized student feedback. My students seem to love the diversity of tools and approaches I used to improve teaching, the clarity of expectations, and the general "vibe" during exercises.
