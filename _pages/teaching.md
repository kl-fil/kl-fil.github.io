I have taught 3 undergrad courses and 1 graduate course from 2019 to 2022. For soem of the courses I designed my own laboratory exercises, seminars and workshops that would equip students with the skills needed to excel in their academic endeavors and possibly, beyond academia.  In 2022 and 2023 I worked closely with master students on their theses to help them learn how to ask questions, analyze and present data, and become experts in their chosen projects.

- 2021-today - Mentoring master students in data analysis and interpretation within TurtleBIOME project (one co-supervision)
- 2022 - Pelagic Microbiology; laboratory exercises for ERASMUS students (on-site)
- 2019-2022 - Microbial Ecology; laboratory exercises (on-site & remote)
- 2019 - Histology and Histochemistry, Histology and embryology; laboratory exercises (on-site)
