I have taught 3 undergrad courses and 1 graduate course from 2019 to 2022 at the University of Zagreb. For some of the courses I designed my own laboratory exercises, seminars and workshops that would equip students with the skills needed to excel in their academic endeavors and possibly, beyond academia.  In 2022 and 2023 I worked closely with master students on their theses to help them learn how to ask questions, analyze and present data, and become experts in their chosen projects.

- 2021-today - Mentoring master students in data analysis and interpretation within TurtleBIOME project (one co-supervision)
- 2022 - Pelagic Microbiology; laboratory exercises for ERASMUS students (on-site)
- 2019-2022 - Microbial Ecology; laboratory exercises (on-site & remote)
- 2019 - Histology and Histochemistry, Histology and embryology; laboratory exercises (on-site)
 
Besides my official duties as university staff, I helped Biology Students Association members in forming their own research proposals, and reviewed sci-pop articles for their magazine *In Vivo*.

In academic year 2022/2023 I was listed as 2nd best teaching assistant (based on a student survey on 166 professors and teaching assistants across 85 courses). The ranking was based on 1-5 points grading system and anonymized student feedback. My students seem to love the diversity of tools and approaches I would use to improve teaching, the clarity of expectations, and the general "vibe" during exercises.
