Hi! I am a **microbiome scientist** with a PhD in microbial ecology from University of Zagreb in Croatia. I am passionate about finding **microbial solutions to global health challenges** - as microbes are full of potential! In 2024, I started working as a **postdoctoral researcher** at Medical University of Graz in Austria within the FWF funded project "Cluster of Excellence: **Microbiomes Drive Planetary Health**". My research activites are spread across Diener lab, Moissl-Eichinger lab and Gorkiewicz lab.

My **research so far**, focused on internal and external **microbial communities** of loggerhead sea turtles: **isolation, culturing and characterization** of individual microbes (diatoms, bacteria), and **DNA-based community surveys** via amplicon sequencing (16S, 18S rRNA, and *rbcL* gene markers on Illumina MiSeq 250 or 300bp paired-end). Within my postdoctoral project I will be expanding my skillset towards **metagenomic data** analyses and **microbial community metabolic models**, along with isolation, cultivation and characterization of keystone taxa in **gastrointestinal tract health disorders**. Feel free to find out more by strolling through my *projects*, *publications* and *CV*.
