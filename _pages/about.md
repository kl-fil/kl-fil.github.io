Hi! I am a freshly baked **PhD in biology** currently working for the [TurtleBIOME](https://www.turtlebiome.biol.pmf.hr/) at the University of Zagreb in Croatia. Also, I am looking for new opportunities to hone my skills in data analysis-science-viz in the **microbiome** domain (as my contract expires in August 2023). **In the future I want to** use my skills to **solve local/global challenges by using the power of microbes and/or (hopefully microbe-associated) big data**.

My **research so far**, focused on internal and external **microbial communities** of loggerhead sea turtles: **isolation, culturing and characterization** of individual microbes (diatoms, bacteria), and **DNA-based community surveys** via amplicon sequencing (16S, 18S rRNA, and *rbcL* gene markers on Illumina MiSeq 250 or 300bp paired-end). Feel free to find out more by strolling through my *projects*, *publications* and *CV*.
