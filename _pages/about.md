Hi! I am a **microbiome enthusiast/scientist** with a PhD in microbial ecology. I am passionate about finding **microbial solutions to global health challenges** - microbes are full of potential! Currently, I am looking for a position where I can express all the microbial joy I have and contribute to finding microbial solutions through data analysis and visualization.

At this time I am undertaking an internship at *Chr. Hansen* in Denmark (they have the largest commercial bacterial strain collections in the world which I find immensely cool) learning more about the commercial use of microbes and their potential in production and growing healthier food.

My **research so far**, focused on internal and external **microbial communities** of loggerhead sea turtles: **isolation, culturing and characterization** of individual microbes (diatoms, bacteria), and **DNA-based community surveys** via amplicon sequencing (16S, 18S rRNA, and *rbcL* gene markers on Illumina MiSeq 250 or 300bp paired-end). Feel free to find out more by strolling through my *projects*, *publications* and *CV*.
